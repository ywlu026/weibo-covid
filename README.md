# Analyzing Sina Weibo response to China's COVID-zero policy
This project analyzes all tweets from Sina Weibo on May 1, 2022, with the keyword "COVID-zero." The aim is to understand the social media topics discussed during the stringent lockdown in Shanghai after China's largest COVID outbreak since the onset of 2022. This is the final project submitted for Professor Rochelle Terman's course PLSC 21510/31510 Introduction to Text as Data for Social Science offered during Spring 2022 at UChicago.
